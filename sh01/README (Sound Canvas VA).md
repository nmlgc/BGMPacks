This regular pack was rendered with fixed MIDI files whose Reverb Macro values were clamped to the SC-88Pro's specified range, retaining the panning delay reverb that ZUN heard on the synth he composed this soundtrack on. Both the OST and AST versions of track #02 (フォルスストロベリー) activate panning delay for just the 8 bars of its piano solo, which provides enough evidence for the delay being indeed intentional.
