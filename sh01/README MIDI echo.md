* Reverb Macro values outside the SC-88Pro's specified range of [0,Â 7] have been clamped to 7 or *Panning Delay*, [matching the behavior of real SC-88Pro hardware](https://twitter.com/Romantique_Tp/status/1766895996645056902). This preserves ZUN's intended reverb setting on other Roland synths that don't clamp, such as the SC-8850 and Sound Canvas VA.
