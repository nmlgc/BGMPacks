## About the recordings

The files in this BGM pack are based on the 16-bit FLAC files from Romantique Tp's SC-88Pro recording project:

Due to the slight timing inaccuracies of real hardware, most loops don't fall on the exact calculated sample positions and thus had to be cut manually to minimize glitches and discontinuities. While the loops do follow the calculated points by being cut slightly after them, cuts like these can only be a best-effort attempt. There is no guarantee that the files in this BGM pack sync up perfectly with the MIDI visualization, especially after they've looped a few times.

In exchange, these recordings preserve the frequency response, resonant filters, and further unidentified quirks of real hardware that are not present in the comparatively drier-sounding Sound Canvas VA version of this BGM pack. The [Reverb Macro issue](https://github.com/nmlgc/BGMPacks/issues/1) has been fixed as of the [TODO TODO TODO release](), though.
