## About the recordings

The files in this BGM pack are based on the 16-bit FLAC files from Romantique Tp's SC-88Pro recording project:

Due to the slight timing inaccuracies of real hardware, most loops don't fall on the exact calculated sample positions and thus had to be cut manually to minimize glitches and discontinuities. While the loops do follow the calculated points by being cut slightly after them, cuts like these can only be a best-effort attempt. There is no guarantee that the files in this BGM pack sync up perfectly with the MIDI visualization, especially after they've looped a few times.

In exchange, these recordings preserve bugs and quirks of real hardware that are not present in the Sound Canvas VA version of this BGM pack. The most notable one is the panning delay in 34 of the 39 tracks across both of Shuusou Gyoku's soundtracks, which is how a SC-88Pro responds to invalid Reverb Macro messages. See [issue #1](https://github.com/nmlgc/BGMPacks/issues/1) for details, and [the corresponding ReC98 blog post](https://rec98.nmlgc.net/blog/2024-03-09) for a more detailed documentation of the differences.
