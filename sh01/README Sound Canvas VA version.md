### Rendering process

All edited MIDI files were rendered using Sound Canvas VA version 1.1.6, which was the latest version available in the [Roland Cloud](https://www.rolandcloud.com/) in mid-December 2023.\
The conversion was done in foobar2000 v2.1.5 x64, with v2.15.0.0 of the [foo_midi component](https://github.com/stuerp/foo_midi).
